	    <p>Super Simple Password Manager is a quick and simple way to manage your password. To get started, all you need to do is pick a passphrase and enter it above. Please note that your passwords will be encrypted so if you forget your passphrase you will no longer be able to access your passwords.
	    </p>
      <p><b>Note: This application is not intended for general use. This is just a quick app put together to allow me to brush up on angularjs and bootstrap. If you want to use the code for another project feel free.</b></p>

				  <h4>What makes a good passphrase?</h4>
				  <ul>
					  <li>Long enough to be hard to guess</li>
					  <li>Not a famous quotation from literature, holy books, etc</li>
					  <li>Hard to guess by intuition--even by someone who knows the user well</li>
					  <li>Easy to remember and type accurately</li>
					  <li>Not reused between sites, applications and other different sources.</li>
				  </ul>

				  <h4>Remember to make backups</h4>
				  <ul>
				   <li>Your passwords are stored locally in your browser so please make use of the export function to make regular backups. The exported file is encrypted using your passphrase so whatever you do don't forget it.</li>
            <li>Your backup file will always be encrypted so even if you have made a backup, if you forget your passphrase your passwords will be inaccessible.</li>

				  <h4>Privacy &amp; Security</h4>
				  <p>No password data is ever passed to any external server, instead all passwords are stored locally in your browser.</p>
				  <p>
SSPM encrypts your password using AES256 when storing your passwords locally. Should someone get hold of your password data they will be unable to get to your passwords without your passphrase.</p>
